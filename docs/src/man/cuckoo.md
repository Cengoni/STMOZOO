## Cuckoo search

This is the cuckoo search method, implemented by Claudia Mengoni. The module allows to solve a minimization problem through the use of the biological-inspired metaheuristic of cuckoo search.

It contains a function to solve this optimization problem and a helper function that generates an initial population to use as input to the main method.
