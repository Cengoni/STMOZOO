## BeesAlgorithm

This documentation contains information about the functions implemented in the BeesAlgorithm module by Tristan and Kirsten.
The Artificial Bee Colonization (ABC) algorithm is a swarm-based metaheuristic for solving numerical optimization problems.
Apart from this algorithm and its required functions, also some test functions are provided to experiment with.
